# Biohazard Hackathon

## Problem:
Pathologist is limited to a single biopsy dataset and repeating the work of their colleagues. 
Limited data access leads to missed opportunities for better treatments and directly impacting people lives.

## Solution:
Biohazard allows pathologists: Upload biopsy results Unify biopsy formats across different softwares Annotate tissue morphologically Enrich biopsy with past annotations and 3rd party datasets

## Feasibility, financials and Impact:
Fully Encrypted at rest and in transit Security is our high-priority - we can integrate with existing system (SAML) Scalable to hundreds of terabytes Cost efficient - $0.028 per 1000 biopsies processed Already partially HIPPA compliant Coverage for multiple laboratories

## What is new about your solution?:
cost efficient ready to deploy

## What comes next and what you wish to achieve:
We are hoping to continue with this project ideally as part of the incubator *caelestinus. We hope to be able to work closely with both astra zeneca as well as the doctors to truly matchtheir needs. We see the power mainly in the sharing of data across laboratories in czech republic with potential to reach across the globe. We see huge potential in leveraging the power of cloud and we believe that we can offer the right expertise to implement a scalable, secure and reliable solution
